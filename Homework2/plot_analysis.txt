B) Assuming my plot and methods are correct, The slopes of all of the methods are simpson's ~3, milne's ~2, and GSL = 0. Of course the GSL slope is going to be zero, because it was a pre-defined function that didn't take any steps, it just spat out an answer. Simpson's rule has a slope of (-)3 in it's stable region from 0 to 10^2, and then error becomes unstable. This behavior makes sense, simpon's rule error scales with N^-4, so we would expect it to go down until it hits computer precision errors.

I've never heard or worked with Milne's rule before this assignment. Under the assumption I've done it correctly, Minle's rule has a slope of (-)2 on it's stable region from 0 to ~10^3 and then becomes unstable. I bet the error is proportional to N^-something, so that would lead to the downward behavior, until it hits computer percision error  

C) Graphically, the optimum number of points to use for milne's rule is around 10^3, the critical point where the analytical error and computer precision error is minimized. That is, analytically, the error scales with 1/N^something, so we want to keep increasing the step size ,N, to get a lower error, but at some point we hit a small enough step that computers, even in double precision, can't keep track of all the decimal places and round off error starts to build. In the notes, this fact is used to derive an approximation for N best, which is N=a/error^2/b. b is the power the error is inversely proptional to, and I don't know it for Milnes rule, hence the N^somethings.
